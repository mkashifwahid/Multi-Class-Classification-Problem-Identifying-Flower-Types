# Multi-Class-Classification-Problem-Identifying-Flower-Types

In this project, you will discover how you can use Keras to develop and evaluate neural network models for multi-class classification projects.
After completing this step-by-step project, you will know:

•	How to load data from CSV and make it available to Keras.

•	How to prepare multi-class classification data for modeling with neural networks.

•	How to evaluate Keras neural network models with scikit-learn
